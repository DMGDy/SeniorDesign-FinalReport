# Senior Design Final Report

This document will be compiled using `pdflatex` to compile a `.tex` file to a `.pdf` document.
A build script has been written to build certain documents with their propper name. All
compiled .pdfs are under `docs/`:
```
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh <draft>
```
For example:

```
./build.sh Outline
```

## Outline

High-level outline of the final report. Should contain:

* Sections of required topics
    * Brief descriptions for each
* Figures (Images, Charts, other visual documentations)
